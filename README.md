# Data Structures for C

This is a repo that contains useful data structures which may be used in various C programs.

Probably, these are not the fastest and not the best implementations, but it's mainly for my usage, and i'm okay with that.

C does not support templates. Because of that, these data structures are written for `short` type, so it's 
easy to fit in any data type by simply using "Change All Occurences" feature in IDE's and text editors.
